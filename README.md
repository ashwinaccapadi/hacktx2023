# AIgon Alley

AI has never been a more creative and innovative space than it is today. We wanted to open the market up to independent developers that have created their own specific use cases. 


AIagon Alley connects buyers with sellers by listing available AI models on the market. Buyers can look through and find a model that they like, and once they do they can pay the seller to use their model on a dataset of their choosing. Sellers can upload their own models and specify an appropriate price. 


Our project structure consisted of a Google Cloud Backend, MongoDB Database, a FLASK API, and React for our frontend. We used a mycompute instance to host the AI models and FLASK APIs to create a stable and efficient backend. We used the MongoDB Database to store the metadata of each user and model on the marketplace. We connected this all together using React and Material UI to create a pleasing user-interface. Our main challenge was integrating our frontend and backend. React had trouble querying to our Rest API and had many type errors. 


We are proud we were able to successfully deploy a functioning marketplace that can self-host and run AI code. We are learned how to create servers in Flask and how to connect to MongoDB database. We are hoping to integrate blockchain to provide user authentication and provide effortless peer-to-peer payments.
